Wraps git with several useful features:

- up - pull current repo and all the dependencies
- all - TODO repeat command for current repo and all dependencies
- scan - scan directory tree recursively to find unsynced repositories
- clone - clone with url resolution

## Installation

No installation required.
It's just a single Python 3 executable without dependencies.

Just download and run.

## Alternatives

I've really tried and spent lot of time looking for already existing tool for the job.
There are lots of them. Maybe you could find something more suitable for your needs.
